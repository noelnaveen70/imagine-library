            <h2>Once Upon a Time...</h2>
            <p> Whispers in the Walls

                Elena and James, a young couple, move into a decaying Victorian house on the outskirts of a quiet town, hoping for a fresh start. The house, with its overgrown garden and eerie charm, seems like the perfect escape from their stressful city life. However, from the moment they arrive, something feels off. Strange whispers echo through the walls, shadows seem to move when no one's around, and unsettling noises keep them awake at night.
                
                Elena dismisses the odd occurrences at first, attributing them to stress and the isolation of their new life. But as the days pass, she begins to experience terrifying visions—faces pressed against the windows that vanish when she looks away, and figures moving in the corners of her vision. Meanwhile, James becomes increasingly fascinated with the house's dark history. He discovers that it once belonged to a wealthy family that mysteriously disappeared decades ago. Rumors of witchcraft and hidden rituals have surrounded the property for generations.
                
                Elena, desperate to understand what’s happening, finds journals in the attic that reveal the story of **Victoria**, the last matriarch of the house, who was accused of practicing witchcraft and died under strange circumstances. The more Elena reads, the more the house seems to respond to her—cold spots appear, and eerie markings begin to show up on her skin. James grows distant, showing signs of possession. He becomes obsessed with a mirror in the basement, speaking in a deep, unnatural voice.
                
                As Elena uncovers the truth, she learns the house is cursed. The spirits of Victoria and her family are trapped within the walls, their souls imprisoned by dark rituals. The house wants to claim the living to replace the dead, and James is slowly being consumed by the curse.
                
                In a final, desperate attempt to break the curse, Elena discovers that to free the spirits, someone must take Victoria's place. James, now fully possessed, offers himself as the sacrifice, but Elena, torn between love and survival, refuses. She seals the curse by sacrificing herself, but unknowingly dooms James to become the new vessel for Victoria's spirit.
                
                The house falls silent, but as Elena steps outside, the town’s people watch her with knowing eyes. The curse is not broken—it’s just transferred. And now, it’s calling for its next victim.</p> </div>

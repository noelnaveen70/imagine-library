            <h2>Once Upon a Time...</h2>
            <p> In a small, forgotten town nestled at the edge of an ancient forest, Sarah, a young botanist, inherits a decaying family estate after her estranged grandfather’s death. The sprawling, overgrown property is both a blessing and a curse: a chance to escape her tumultuous life in the city and research the mysterious plants her grandfather had obsessively studied. But as Sarah settles in, she begins to notice something strange. The garden—once wild and untamed—appears to be dying. Plants wither, and trees rot, despite her best efforts to care for them.

                Soon, Sarah’s fascination turns to unease. At night, the walls of the house groan with strange, almost organic sounds, like roots growing beneath the floorboards. She finds old journals in the attic, written by her grandfather, chronicling his experiments with a rare plant species he called "The Withering Blossom." According to his notes, the plant had the power to extend life, but at a horrific cost. It thrived by draining the vitality from its surroundings, causing the land and people to decay.
                
                As Sarah digs deeper, she discovers the true nature of the plant’s curse. Her grandfather had become obsessed with it, convinced it could cure his failing health. But in the process, he had unknowingly planted the Withering Blossom at the heart of the estate. The plant, now entwined with the land itself, was poisoning the earth, causing everything around it to wither and die—including Sarah’s own body.
                
                Strange visions begin to haunt Sarah—glimpses of her grandfather, long deceased, wandering the garden in a deteriorating state, his body slowly decaying. She realizes he had not died but had merged with the plant, becoming part of the cursed land. The more Sarah tries to rid herself of the plant, the more it clings to her, draining her energy and vitality.
                
                In a desperate attempt to break the cycle, Sarah decides to burn the Withering Blossom. But as the flames consume the garden, the plant’s twisted roots reach for her, pulling her into the earth. She screams in agony as her body withers, becoming part of the land, forever trapped in the cycle of decay.
                
                The next morning, the garden is quiet. A new, fresh blossom begins to bloom at the center, its roots spreading deep beneath the soil, waiting for its next victim.</p> </div>

            <h2>Once Upon a Time...</h2>
            <p>Father Michael Donovan had seen his share of darkness over his years as an exorcist, but nothing prepared him for what he faced in the abandoned house on Willow Street. The air was thick with the stench of decay, and the walls, once white, were now stained a deep, unnerving red. It was rumored that this house had a history, but Michael hadn’t been prepared for what was lurking inside.

                The young girl, Emma, had been possessed for over a month, her body contorting in ways that defied physics. Her parents, desperate and terrified, had turned to Father Donovan after every other priest had failed. His reputation was built on his success, but this case felt different. There was a malevolence here that clawed at his very soul.
                
                He entered the room where Emma lay, strapped to the bed, her eyes wide open and black as coal. Her mouth was a gaping chasm, and from it, a low, guttural voice emerged. “Leave... now... or die.”
                
                Father Donovan stepped forward, gripping his rosary tightly. “In the name of God, I command you to leave this child.”
                
                The air grew colder. The candles flickered. Emma’s body twisted unnaturally, her head turning fully around, her neck cracking in the process. The room seemed to pulse with dark energy, a force so potent it nearly knocked him back.
                
                "You're too late, priest," the voice hissed. "This one is mine. She’s the key."
                
                Father Donovan clenched his fists, summoning all the faith he could muster. He recited the ancient prayers, his voice unwavering despite the pressure building around him. The words of the exorcism echoed off the walls, growing louder, more powerful, until the house itself seemed to shake with the force of his conviction.
                
                Emma’s body convulsed violently, her mouth frothing. The demonic presence screeched in fury, but the more Michael spoke, the weaker the voice became. Finally, with one last, piercing scream, the darkness exploded out of Emma, a black mist that swirled around the room and then vanished into the air.
                
                The girl lay still, her body limp, her eyes now clear and filled with the innocence of youth. Father Donovan collapsed to his knees, exhausted but relieved. The house was silent, as if it, too, had exhaled in peace.
                
                The demon was gone—but for how long? The shadows lingered in the corners of the room, a reminder that evil was always waiting, biding its time.

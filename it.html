            <h2>Once Upon a Time...</h2>
            <p>In a forgotten corner of a rural town, Maya inherits an old, crumbling house from her reclusive aunt, who passed away under mysterious circumstances. The house, surrounded by a wild garden, is the perfect escape for Maya, who seeks solace after the loss of her mother. But there’s something unsettling about the place. Despite the overgrown plants and unkempt yard, the flowers and trees seem to pulse with an unnatural energy.

                As Maya begins cleaning up the estate, she notices strange changes. The plants grow unnaturally fast, their tendrils reaching toward her as if alive. Flowers wilt and die in her presence, but there’s always a new one in the same spot the next day. The house itself seems to breathe, the walls creaking and groaning in the dead of night.
                
                While sorting through her aunt’s belongings, Maya finds a collection of journals. Her aunt, Elise, had been obsessed with gardening, and the journals detail her attempts to grow a rare, mystical flower known as the Withering Blossom. According to Elise’s writings, the flower had the ability to restore youth and vitality—but at a terrifying cost. It thrived by draining the life force from everything around it, causing decay and death to spread across the land.
                
                Maya dismisses the journals as the ramblings of a delusional woman, but the more she stays in the house, the more she begins to feel its pull. Her energy wanes, and she becomes obsessed with the garden. The air around her feels thick, like the plants are watching her every move. One night, after a fitful sleep, she wakes to find her reflection in the mirror is distorted—her face, hollow and withered, as if aged years in a single night.
                
                Desperate for answers, Maya digs deeper into the garden and uncovers the Withering Blossom at its heart. The flower, glowing faintly in the moonlight, seems to call to her. As her fingers brush its petals, the ground trembles, and the house groans as if waking from a long slumber. Maya realizes the truth: she has been feeding the plant her life force all along, and now it demands its full price.
                
                As her body weakens, Maya attempts to destroy the flower, but the roots entwine her, pulling her into the soil. The house falls silent. The next morning, a new blossom blooms at the garden’s center, waiting for the next lost soul</p> </div>

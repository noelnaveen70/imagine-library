            <h2>Once Upon a Time...</h2>
            <p>It was a crisp October evening when Claire and her friends, eager to celebrate Halloween, decided to visit the infamous Woodsman’s Hollow, a dense forest on the outskirts of their small town. Locals whispered about the place—some said it was cursed, others claimed it was haunted by the spirit of a woodsman who disappeared decades ago, leaving behind only blood-stained tracks and eerie warnings carved into the trees. But for Claire and her friends, it was the perfect spot for a night of ghost stories and fun.

                They arrived just as the sun dipped below the horizon, the moon casting a pale glow over the twisted trees. Armed with flashlights, they ventured deep into the hollow, laughing and joking to mask the unease that began to creep over them as the forest grew darker and the air thicker. The sounds of the night—rustling leaves, distant hoots of owls—seemed too quiet, almost unnatural.
                
                After an hour of wandering, they found a small clearing, the perfect spot for their campfire. But just as they set it up, Claire noticed something strange: the trees around them seemed to be marked with deep, jagged cuts, as if someone—or something—had clawed at them. Shaking off the feeling, they began telling ghost stories, the flickering firelight dancing on their faces. But every now and then, Claire would hear a faint rustling behind them, like footsteps too light to catch with the eye.
                
                When it was Claire’s turn to tell a story, she stood and turned around to face the trees. Her voice faltered as a cold wind whipped through the clearing, and she saw something in the distance—shadows moving unnaturally, too fast and too high to be animals. She blinked, and they were gone.
                
                The group laughed nervously, but the tension was palpable. That’s when the first scream pierced the air. It came from Jake, one of Claire’s friends. They turned to find him standing frozen, staring into the darkness, his face pale. His flashlight had fallen to the ground, and when Claire rushed over to him, she found his eyes wide with terror—he couldn’t speak.
                
                Then, the sound came—cracking branches, scraping noises from all sides, and something heavy, dragging itself closer. They realized too late: they weren’t alone. The Woodsman had returned.
                
                The forest seemed to close in on them, the trees leaning toward the clearing, their branches like fingers reaching for their prey. Claire grabbed Jake’s arm, pulling him away, but as they ran, they could hear footsteps—slow, deliberate, following them. The last thing Claire remembered before everything went black was the flash of an ax gleaming in the moonlight.
                
                The next morning, the forest was silent again. Claire’s friends were gone, and she was found lying alone in the clearing, the woodsman’s ax buried in the dirt beside her. She couldn’t remember how she had escaped—or what had happened to her friends—but the terror of that night would haunt her forever.

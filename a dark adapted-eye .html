            <h2>Once Upon a Time...</h2>
            <p> "A Dark-Adapted Eye" is a compelling mystery novel by British author Ruth Rendell, first published in 1986. The novel centers around the theme of family secrets, guilt, and the complex nature of truth. It tells the story of a deeply dysfunctional family, focusing on the death of a beloved family member and the haunting question of whether it was a murder or an accident.

                The narrative unfolds through the perspective of the central character, the enigmatic and reclusive Vera Hillyard. The story is set in post-war England, and it begins with the murder of Vera's brother, the charming but morally ambiguous Edwin. He is killed under suspicious circumstances, and suspicion falls on several family members, including Vera. The story takes place years after the event, when Vera’s niece, a journalist named Ruth, begins investigating the circumstances surrounding Edwin’s death.
                
                As Ruth uncovers more about her family’s dark history, she learns that Vera had been deeply affected by the events of the past. Vera, who had always been known for her emotional detachment, becomes an increasingly mysterious figure in Ruth's investigation. Ruth’s attempts to piece together the truth are hindered by the silence and resistance of family members, each of whom has their own version of events, colored by personal motives and memories. What becomes clear is that the truth about Edwin's death is hidden behind layers of deception, guilt, and emotional trauma.
                
                Ruth’s investigation is complicated by her growing realization that the people she has trusted, particularly Vera, might not be telling her the truth. As she digs deeper into the past, she discovers that Vera had been in the midst of a violent confrontation with Edwin at the time of his death, and that Vera's dark, almost pathological, jealousy played a key role in the unraveling of the family’s secrets. Yet, the novel explores not just the events leading to the murder but also the psychological and emotional impact of those events on the people involved.
                
                The climax of the novel is both surprising and unsettling, revealing that the line between guilt and innocence is often blurred. "A Dark-Adapted Eye" is a masterfully written psychological mystery that delves into the complexities of memory, identity, and the human capacity for deception. Ruth Rendell’s atmospheric storytelling, combined with her sharp psychological insights, makes this novel a haunting exploration of family, guilt, and the search for truth.</p> </div>
